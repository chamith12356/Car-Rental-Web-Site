      <p>Each person who intends to drive must bring a valid driver's license to drive in Japan, passport, and a valid means of payment (generally via credit card). All of these items must be submitted on the day the car will be picked up. Kindly pay with an affiliated credit card. If you wish to pay in cash, you must also submit an item of identification (copies are acceptable) in addition to your driver's license.</p>

    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow mb-4">
      <h3 class="h5 mb-2">What should I do if I damage the car?</h3>
      <p>In the event that the customer causes an accident or defacement to the vehicle during the rental period, the user shall be required to pay the non-operation charge (NOC) as partial compensation for the loss of earnings incurred for repairs or cleaning, regardless of the degree of damage or the length of time required for repairs/cleaning.
The non-operation charge (NOC) is different from the deductible (paid by the user) in the insurance and compensation system, which is applied in the event of accidents. Please note that this sum is to be paid even if you are subscribed to the Safety Package.</p>

    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow mb-4">
      <h3 class="h5 mb-2">What should I do if I get in an accident?</h3>
      <p>Please follow the procedure below if you get involved in an accident:<br>

(1) Move the vehicle to a safe location to prevent further accidents.<br>
(2) Assist all injured parties.<br>
(3) Report the accident to the police.<br>
(4) Get the details of the other party.<br>
(5) Contact the Global Customer Desk.<br>
Do not negotiate a private settlement on the spot. Private settlements will invalidate the insurance, which will require the user to pay the entire cost.</p>
